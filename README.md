Hi Everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chijioke, and welcome to my GitHub!
Iâ€™m a passionate Data Analytics professional with a love for diving deep into the world of data. Right now, Iâ€™m sharpening my skills in SQL, Excel, and PowerBI to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can do with data.
By day, I work as a QA/QC Analyst in the construction industry, where I ensure that the integrity and reinforcement of structural elements are spot on with the help of some solid statistics and quality control measures. Basically, I keep things standing strong (literally)! ðŸ’ª
My go-to tools? Excel Syntax, vBA Macro, Powerpivot, DAX Measures, and Power Query M. Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to make data work smarter, not harder.
On the side, Iâ€™m all about integrating data analytics into my everyday tasks to streamline processes and make sure decisions are based on solid data. Iâ€™m also a bit of a data entry wizard, creating templates, projects, and models to boost efficiency and keep things running smoothly.
When Iâ€™m not deep in data, Iâ€™m looking for new ways to collaborate with other professionalsâ€”whether you're in *data analytics, supply chain management, statistics, or business. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, share, and contribute to exciting new projects.
Fun fact: I LOVE tackling the messiest tasks first. Give me an ugly data cleaning job, and Iâ€™m all over it. Thereâ€™s something oddly satisfying about transforming chaos into clarity. ðŸ˜„
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, Twitter, Email, Upwork, or even WhatsApp! Let's build something awesome together.
