Hi Everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chijioke, and welcome to my GitHub!
Iâ€™m a passionate *Data Analytics professional* who loves diving deep into the world of data. Currently, Iâ€™m sharpening my skills in SQL, Excel, and Power BI, pushing the boundaries of what data can do. 
By day, I teach *data analysis and analytics using Excel and Power BI. I also work as a *QA/QC Analyst* in the construction industry, where I ensure the integrity and reinforcement of structural elements are spot on, thanks to some solid statistics and quality control measures. Basically, I help keep things standing strongâ€”literally! ðŸ’ª

### Tools I love using:
- *Excel Syntax*
- *vBA Macro*
- *PowerPivot*
- *DAX Measures*
- *Power Query M*
- *Calculated Column*
- *Power Pivot*

Iâ€™m always on the lookout for ways to make data work smarter, not harder. Besides that, I also enjoy *career services work* and love integrating data analytics into my everyday tasks to streamline processes and make sure decisions are backed by solid data. Iâ€™m also big on *data entry*, creating databases and templates with Excel, building projects, establishing relationship between tables in Power BI, and developing models to boost efficiency and keep everything running smoothly.

When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in data, Iâ€™m eager to collaborate with professionals from all fieldsâ€”whether youâ€™re into data analytics, supply chain management, finance & statistics, or business. Iâ€™m always up for learning, sharing, and contributing to exciting projects.

Fun fact about me: I LOVE tackling the messiest tasks first. Give me a chaotic data cleaning job, and Iâ€™m all over it. Thereâ€™s something deeply satisfying about turning chaos into clarity. ðŸ˜„
Feel free to connect with me on *LinkedIn, **Twitter, **Email, **Upwork, or even **WhatsApp*! Letâ€™s build something awesome together.
