Hi CollaboratorsðŸ‘‹, I'm CJ, a Data Analytics and certified maritime professional with a drive to continually expanding my skills in the data world, particularly in Data Analytics. Currently, I am enhancing my expertise in SQL, PowerBI, Excel, and Tableau. Besides my analytical pursuits, I freelance as a QA/QC in the construction industry, my primary responsibility revolves around ensuring the integrity and reinforcement of structural elements through meticulous analysis and quality control measures.
My languages and tools include: SQL, PowerBI, Excel, Power Query, and Tableau.
Base on my projects and interests: At the core of my work lies the utilization of data analytics skills to meticulously monitor and assess various parameters essential for the construction process. One of the key aspects involves the collection and analysis of cube samples from concrete mixes. Each sample serves as a data point, capturing vital information such as the date of production, volume of concrete utilized, slump value, and the curing process for 7 and 28 days. 
Upon gathering this data, the next step involves subjecting the cube samples to rigorous integrity tests. These tests are conducted to determine the compressive strength of the concrete, a critical factor in assessing its suitability for structural applications.Adhering to stringent criteria, I analyze the results of the integrity tests with precision. For instance, if the compressive strength of a sample exceeds 28 N/mmÂ² after 7 days of curing, it is deemed to pass this stage of assessment. Similarly, for samples subjected to 28 days of curing, a compressive strength exceeding 35.5 N/mmÂ² signifies a passing grade. Any deviation from these benchmarks prompts further investigation and corrective measures.
I am eager to collaborate with data professionals, maritime logistcs, structural & building engineers statisticians, and business experts to expand my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects.
One fun fact about me, I love tackling the dirtiest and ugliest tasks first; perhaps thatâ€™s why I enjoy data cleaning so much!
